It is just perfect!
The sound is terrific.
The storyline is flat and uninventive.
Simple, but addicting.
This is not fun.
I was disappointed.
I wasn't disappointed.
Don't waste your money on this.
This is the worst VH album of all time.
I don't think so.
The last few intensive notes end this song beautifully.
I liked the book
I didn't like the book.
