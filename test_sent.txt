This CD was horrible.
The controls are lousy.
This is not fun.
I was extremely disappointed.
This movie is the pits.
I liked this film.
This is a really cool story.
The first few CD's are very entertaining.
A good beginner's tablet.
The game has a very easy learning curve.
It's your choice.
The gameplay is very, very good.
I loved the strong, independent main character.
Looks good.
Guthrie is a lyrical genius.
It won't taste nice, and it's a bore.
Great remakes are few and rare.
I read the book and like it very much.
I like the character Eragon and he seemed to be maturing in this book.
I love their cd and I love them.
They are cute and they can sing and dance.
Her voice is silky and direct, and her lyrics are smart and direct.
I've heard them better, but far away from good.
But this CD is AWSOME!!!
Mr. Lieven does an excellent job, but readers should worry about potential bias.
I did not like any of the songs.
it's not a good game.
Nothing negative about it.
You will NOT be disappointed.
